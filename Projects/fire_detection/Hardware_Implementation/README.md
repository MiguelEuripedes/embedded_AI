# ðŸ”¥Fire Detection Using Image Classification

Here is the final step of creating a Fire Detection Classifier where I implement the model created in a the Arduino BLE 33 Sense. 

As part of this project I made a article and publish it on [Medium]([https://medium.com/@miguel.amaral.111/fire-detection-example-using-image-classification-with-edge-impulse-116745bb3bb0]), there I explain better the process of creating a model on [Edge Impulse]([https://www.edgeimpulse.com/]) using transfer-learning. 

Here I'd like to share a apresentation that I made for the course of Embedded IA offered by [Ivanovitch Silva]([https://github.com/ivanovitchm/embedded.ai]). other than the presentation, you can also have access to the code of the arduino lib which I used to run the model on the board.
