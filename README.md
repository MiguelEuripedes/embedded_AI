# DCA 0306 - Embedded Artificial Intelligence - UFRN

This is a repository created for the discipline of Embedded Artificial Intelligence, taught by Prof. Ivanovitch Silva, at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte - Brazil. 

Here I'll be displaying mainly contents created by me about the subject and the progress made troughtout the course.

## ðŸ“š Projects:

- First Image Classifier: Project to classify if a image is weather a Panda, a Dog or a Cat. Where I created a very simple MLP model using aspects of MLOps with Weights and Biases.

- LeNet-5 MNIST Classifier: Project with the objective to work with one of the most known CNN, and giving some introduction to Data Augmentation, Batch Normalization, Dropout, etc. All the project was done using Sweeps, the Weights and Biases tool for hyperparameter tuning.
